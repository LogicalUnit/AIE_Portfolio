# AIE_Portfolio
Academy of Interactive Entertainment 2009
This is a dump of all the .h and .cpp files that were included in my AIE 2009 Advanced Diploma portfolio disc.
It contains a combination of my own original work, and the libraries that I used.
The code was written in Visual Studio, but I have omitted all the generated configuration files for brevity.
This means the code won't compile or run without additional work.
